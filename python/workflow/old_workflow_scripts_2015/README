This directory contains all of the files which were created as part of a
workflow for the MRP/Mercury 2015 dataset. On 1-4-2017 I started restructuring
my scripts directory structure for the following reasons:

1. There were too many scripts and I was losing track of which contained what
2. I was not using functions in my scripts, instead copying and pasting
   into iPython.
3. Filenames for most important workflow files started with numbers in an
   attempt to order them in directory view but this makes it impossible to
   import these files into a python interpreter.

Use these files as reference when creating new functions from old codes.
